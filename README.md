# git-check-repos
A very simple bash script to find all git repos and access them easily.

Usage: git-check-repos [-u] [-c] [-l] [-h] [-C]
      -u         Update repository lists
      -c         Manage all repo (returns a shell for each)
      -C         Like -c but only for changed repos
      -l         List repository status
      -h         Print this information

Running for the first time:
1. Change HARDCODED directories.
2. Create list of repos with -u
3. Manually omit repos file
4. Check status with -l


Yes, yes, yes... I'm lazy...
